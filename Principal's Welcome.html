      <h1><i>Principal's commentary</i></h1>
  <p>
    It is my pleasure to once again pen this article in our annual school magazine,<br>'The spotlight', issue no.6.
    Limphus School is now a fully fledged boys' boarding extra-county school registered as five streame with effect from this year.
    As a school,we have devoted ourselves to providing a learner friendly environment through the renovation of structures,landscaping 
    and expansion of existing buildings.We intend to make the school a world class learning institution.<br>
    To support the curriculum development and performance,we have succefully installed wi-fi and equipped the library to acceptable standards.
    E-learning is now a reality.<br>With the new board of management(B.O.M),2018 has been set as the year of <i><b>rebranding</i></b> Limphus School.
    The process of transforming and remodelling the school culture and ethos is ongoing.Indeed,the development of the strategic plan 2018-2022 is underway.It is my conviction that the process which is all inclusive will go a long way in positioning the school as among the best in the region.
    As a school we are proud of the focus and initiative made by the members of the Students Council and all students in general,which has brought a novel way-a complete departure from the old ways-of approaching issues and providing solutions to challenges.In this regard,the school has supported the coucil by providing capacity building workshops.The members of the Teaching and Nonteaching staff have also been equipped with the required knowledge and information to enable them to embrace new approaches in our quest to provide quality and effective service.Teamwork is the oil that presently propels us towards achieving our goals.In actual fact,we have a "NEW SCHOOL"!
    Amid all these new adjustments,Limphus School has continued to perform well in both curricular and co-curricular activities.We give all the necessary support to our teams to enable the boys to utilize their talents.This one team,the rugby 15s,has particularly given our school a place among the great schools up to the regional finals.Music,Drama and Acrobats have also continued to compete favorably in the region.
    In matters academic,the school is still one to beat in the Sub-county both in Sub-county tests and in the KCSE.Although we did not perform exemprarily well in KCSE in 2015,stagnating at a mean standard score of 7.2,we are proud to have increased the number of direct public university enrollment from 29 in 2014 to 41 in 2015.This figure can only keep rising.
    Our school target for 2016 is 8.5.It is realistic and our current Form 4 class has sworn to bring the ship safely home.The determination of this class cannot be over-emphasized!The administration pledges its unwavering support to this promising candidature and the rest of the school as a whole.We cannot build our school in a day,or make it the hub of exemplary achievement in a flash; but sngle-minded,having faith in ourselves,and knowing that continual growth and progress giving meaning to word achievement.
    Theeodore Roosevelt once said that "Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it maens effort,pain,difficulty.. i have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life.i have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well"
    We as a school have the strength of mind to overcome all obstacles together and achieving our goals<br>
    May God be with us all!<br>
    God bless Limphus School.<br>

    Principal </b>
