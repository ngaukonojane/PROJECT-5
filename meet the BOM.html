	<h1><b>Message from the B.O.M chair</b></h1>
	<P>
	To God be the glory for this far He has brought Limphus fraternity.Limphus School is founded on strong Christian principals as a result of devoted foundation in the 21st century and this makes us forever recount the faithfulness of God.We salute the heroes of faith.
<br>
We indeed thank the Board of Governors who have been running this school over the years for their able leadership under our supportive sponsors.We indeed appreciate their spiritual,physical,moral and social encouragement.May the sponsers continue to grow spiritually,numerically,financially and geographically.<br>
Appreciation too goes to our partners in education,notably The ministry of Education Science and Technology for providing us wiyh the grants to run the institution, The T.S.C for providing teaching personnel to implement the curriculum, The community for providing various services to the school and propagating a sense of belonging to the school.<br>
We have a serene environment suitable for academic  pursuits which gives students an opportunity to excel in academics, discover and develop their talents and skills so as to turn out holistic citizens, in preparation for the rigorous life that awaits them.Students,always remember that you must embrace excellence,creativity and innovation as the world has become a global village.<br>
Limphus School is run by a Board of Management that comprises well selected members of the society who assist the principal and other administration staff. The B.O.M is selflessly committed to ensuring that the school is both academically and financially healthy. This will be achieved by offering effective transformational leadership which will lead to improved perfoemance, enrolment, infrastructure, human resource and community service.To realize this, i call upon the teaching staff to continue equipping the students with knowledge, skills and values which will help the students to realize their full potential.<br>
I also entreat the nonteaching staff to offer their services selflessly which indeed would enable the students to learn.To the parents, i urge you to continuously guide and counsel these children, attend consultation meetings devotedly and fulfill your financial obligations.<br>
Students you must grow to be individuals with high self-esteem,self-drive,confidence,etiquette and focus with the aim of developimg full potential in knowledge,skills,values and attitudes.This will help you to become useful to yourselves,the community and the wider society.<br>
To all of us i call upon TEAM WORK.<Br>
